2. Copy the following URL ```https://github.com/domweronika/MixedMessages-ConsoleApp.git```.
3. Open your terminal
4. Use the ```cd``` command to get to a directory where you would like to save your cloned repository.
   For example - If you want to save it in a directory called ```clonedRepos``` which is placed in the document directory:
   ```cd documents/clonedRepos```
5. Now that youre inside the the directory where you want to clone this repository into, in the terminal console, type:
   ```git clone https://github.com/domweronika/MixedMessages-ConsoleApp.git```
6. Next you should see something like this in you terminal, letting you know that the cloning was successful:

   ```remote: Total 28 (delta 6), reused 0 (delta o), pack-reused 0 (from 0)```

   ```Receiving objects: 100% (28/28), 10.42 KiB | 1.49 MiB/s, done.```

## Usage
1. Open terminal and navigate to the address of where the cloned repository was saved. Go further than the example of clonedRepos directory. This directory holds the directory you need to be in, which is the ```MixedMessages-ConsoleApp```

For example:

```cd documents/clonedRepos/MixedMessages-ConsoleApp```

2. Then once inside the cloned repository, type ```node``` followed by file name ```mixedMessages.js``` into the console and hit enter to generate a random quote.
3. Repeat step 3 to generate another quote.
