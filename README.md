# Codecademy Project - Mixed Messages

A simple Node.js console application that generates a random quote from the popular tv series 'Supernatural' each time it runs. Built with JavaScript.

## Features
Randomly selects from an array of quotes
  
## Installation

1. Ensure you have``` node.js``` installed on your computer.
- Do this by opening your terminal and typing ```node``` into the console.
- You should either see the version of node or an error claiming it is not installed/doesnt exist.
- If it doesnt exist, head over to [Node Official Website](www.nodejs.org/download) and follow the instructions.
- Once installed check again if node is present on your system, by opening terminal and typing ```node```
  
2. Close terminal and refer back to this repository
   
3. Clone this repository:   
- Click on **green** ```<> Code ``` button on the top right hand corner of repository
- Copy the following URL ```https://github.com/domweronika/MixedMessages-ConsoleApp.git```.
- Open your terminal
-  Use the ```cd``` command to get to a directory where you would like to save your cloned repository.
   For example - If you want to save it in a directory called ```clonedRepos``` which is placed in the document directory:
   ```cd documents/clonedRepos```
-  Now that youre inside the the directory where you want to clone this repository into, in the terminal console, type:

    ```git clone https://github.com/domweronika/MixedMessages-ConsoleApp.git```

- Next you should see something like this in you terminal, letting you know that the cloning was successful:

    ```PS C:\Users\username\documents\clonedRepos> git clone https://github.com/domweronika/MixedMessages-ConsoleApp.git```

    ```Cloning into 'MixedMessages-ConsoleApp'...```

   ```remote: Enumerating objects: 28, done.```

   ```remote: Counting objects: 100% (28/28), done.```

   ```remote: Compressing objescts: 100% (26/26), done.```

   ```remote: Total 28 (delta 6), reused 0 (delta o), pack-reused 0 (from 0)```

   ```Receiving objects: 100% (28/28), 10.42 KiB | 1.49 MiB/s, done.```

   ```Resolving deltas: 100% (6/6), done.```

- Close the terminal



## Usage
1. Open terminal and navigate to the address of where the cloned repository was saved. Go further than the example of clonedRepos directory. This directory holds the directory you need to be in, which is the ```MixedMessages-ConsoleApp```

    *For example:* ```cd documents/clonedRepos/MixedMessages-ConsoleApp```

2. Then once inside the cloned repository, type ```node``` followed by file name ```mixedMessages.js``` into the console and hit enter to generate a random quote.
3. Repeat step 2 to generate another quote.
